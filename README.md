## üí´ About
**Carter Kruse** <br>
*Dartmouth College '25 | Jack Byrne Scholar | Mathematics and Computer Science*

<!-- I am passionate about using my knowledge of these subjects to tackle challenging problems and find innovative solutions.

In my studies, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from developing algorithms to analyze large datasets to exploring the intersection of mathematics and computer science in areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am constantly striving to learn more and expand my skill set, and I am excited to see where my studies will take me in the future.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I am also heavily involved in extracurricular activities on campus. I am a member of the Dartmouth Mathematical Society and Dartmouth Outing Club and enjoy playing on the Dartmouth Club Soccer team. I am also an avid volunteer and have spent time within Dartmouth Rotaract working on projects that aim to make a positive impact in my community. -->

In the future, I hope to use my knowledge and experience to make a meaningful contribution to the fields of mathematics and computer science, and I am always open to connecting with others who share my interests. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn and connect!
